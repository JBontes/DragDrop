1. Supported platforms:
-------------------------------------------
This version of the library has been tested with Delphi 5, Delphi 7, Delphi 2007,
Delphi 2009 and Delphi 2010 and Delphi XE7 on Windows XP Professional SP3 and Windows 7 Pro.
Other versions of Delphi, C++ Builder and Windows may be supported.

-------------------------------------------
2. Installation:
-------------------------------------------
1. If you are using a previous version of the Drag and Drop Component Suite, uninstall that
   version first.

2. Unzip the package to a folder of your choice.

3. In the Packages folder, find the design time package that matches your version of Delphi.
   Open it in Delphi, Compile and Install.
3a. For 64-bit versions locate DragDropR64bit.dpk, open it in Delphi and Build.

4. Locate the Library sub-folder that matches your version of Delphi. Add it to the Delphi
   library search path.

5. Optional: Add the Source folder to the Delphi browsing path.

-------------------------------------------
3. Uninstallation:
-------------------------------------------
1. Open Delphi and uninstall the Drag and Drop Component Suite design time package.
   Note that the DragDropD2011.dpk package will work for all later versions of Delphi.

2. Remove the Library folder from the Delphi library search path.

3. Remove the Source folder from the Delphi browsing path.

4. Locate the folder where you installed The Drag and Drop Component Suite and 
   delete that folder.

4. Known issues:
-------------------------------------------
* When the demo applications are compiled with Delphi 7, some of them
  will probably emit a lot of "Unsafe type", "Unsafe code" etc. warnings.
  This doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with the demos. It just
  means that Borland, at that time, wanted you to know that they were
  moving to .NET and would like you to do the same (so you can buy the
  next version of Delphi).
  You can turn the warnings of in the project options.

* Delphi's and C++Builder's HWND and THandle types are not compatible.
  For this reason it might be nescessary to cast C++Builder's HWND values to
  Delphi's THandle type when a HWND is passed to a function. E.g.:

    if (DragDetectPlus(reinterpret_cast<THandle>(Handle), Point(X, Y))) {
      ...
    }

* Virtual File Stream formats can only be pasted from the clipboard with live
  data (i.e. FlushClipboard/OleFlushClipboard hasn't been called on the data
  source). This problem affects TFileContentsStreamOnDemandClipboardFormat and
  the VirtualFileStream demo.
  This is believed to be a bug in the Windows clipboard and a work around hasn't
  been found yet.

* When TDropFileTarget.GetDataOnEnter is set to True, the component doesn't work
  with WinZip.
  Although the file names are received correctly by TDropFileTarget, WinZip
  doesn't extract the files and the files thus can't be copied/moved.
  This is caused by a quirk in WinZip; Apparently WinZip doesn't like
  IDataObject.GetData to be called before IDropTarget.Drop is called.
  
* When dragging a file between two applications running under different privileges 
  the drop may fail. This is not a fault of the library, but a consequence of the 
  new protection measures built into Windows Vista et al.
